Example of a barebones Laravel + Vue project that shows that the main Vue component "app" runs twice.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Clone repo
2. Open terminal in project directory
3. Serve the project i.e. "php artisan serve"
4. Open your browser and enter the home page, typically runs on port 8000: "localhost:8000/home"
5. Open developer tools (Ctrl + Shift +  I) and see how the word "app" appears twice.
